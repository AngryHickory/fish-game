# fish-game
A simple fishing RPG game.
This is based on the Dragon Repeller project on freeCodeCamp.org,
but with some added features and more complex logic.


To do: 
- Go Fishing will spawn random fish encounters [X]
- Instead of a final boss, open seas location with stronger fish [X]
- Fish scale in difficulty [X]
- More rods [X]
- Brace move will have a chance to reflect damage [X]
- Save function, autosave?
